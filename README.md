NuGet package for functionality for estimating profits/losses given a solar array proposal.  

This package attempts to answer the question of "With a proposal of `x` kw generation/year, at `y` per month, for `z` years, at what point during the financing terms do the solar panels become cheaper than not having them?"

If you find package useful, and would like to help support a dude in getting more stuff like this out there, there's a little donatey boi up at the top
