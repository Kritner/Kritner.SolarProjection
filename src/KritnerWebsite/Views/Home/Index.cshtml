        This is my personal site.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'll use this site as a test area to work on honing my programming skills.
        I've not had much opportunity to work on front end and MVC,
        so that's where I will get started!

        Seems I got .netcore successfully hosted, but having trouble with DB...
        going to look into that as well as getting a cert so I can SSL/TLS this thing up
